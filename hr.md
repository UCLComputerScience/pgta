### Confirming appointments

Under no circumstances should Module leads/supervisors contact PhDs directly to appointment them to modules, without
first discussing with Tobias Ritschel, the departmental tutor and CS HR staffing.
(TR: Wrong, no tutor involved, no discussion involed)

### Right to work

All employees, including PGTAs, must present their Right To Work before the start of their contract and cannot commence
work until the original has been verified by a member of staff. PGTAs will not be paid if they attempt to work before
they have submitted their RTW. It is the Module Leaders responsibility to ensure that their PGTA(s) have been properly
recruited, that they are fully compliant with UK Government legislation before they delegate tasks to them for the
module. Please check with the staffing team before assigning duties.
(TR: It is implausible to "check with staffings before assigning duties". This is redundant at best.).

### Contract & FTE

PGTAs are employed as members of staff on short term contracts. They cannot work more than 180 hours/year or 6
hours/week as per the Postgraduate Teaching Assistant Code of Practice.
(TR: This is said to the PhD, as it is a) impossible for the ML to check if the constraintis met b) Tobias would tell them if they try to hire an individual for 180+ or something violating visa regulations etc. It is not something ML need to know)

Their FTE will be determined by the total amount of hours worked, and will be calculated based upon the current term
dates. i.e. if someone is allocated 100 hours and the term is 10 weeks their FTE will be calculated over the 10 week
period, however the PGTA may be required to work some of those hours, outside of term time in preparation for the module
but their total work must not exceed their allocated hours.
(TR: This is not information relevant to ML.)

Any training, preparation and marking within the same term
must be factored into the total hours allocation for the module.
(TR: This is impossible, as the ML do not know, in particular when they advertise, if the successful applicant has gone by Arean one or not. How about those who have the information automate this step, e.g. HR.)

PGTAs who work across more than one term will have their FTE calculated from separately for each term.

### Marking in Term 3

If a PGTA is required to complete some marking in term 3 and these have not been allocated within the FTE then we will
process a one off payment for the PGTA for the agreed marking hours. The PGTA must request payment from the staffing
team once the marking is complete. The Staffing team will verify with the Teaching & Learning team to ensure the marks
have been received before making payment.
(TR: No TA can ever "request payment"? Sounds like a honey pot.)

### Changes to PGTA contract hours

Changing PGTA hours once they have been allocated is to be avoided.

#### Decreases in FTE

If a PGTA has their hours' allocation reduced the staffing team must be informed immediately, so they can make the
necessary changes to the contract and avoid the PGTA being overpaid.

#### Increases in FTE

Any increases to PGTA FTE allocation will be made once a term only at the end of the contract. The PGTA must inform
staffing that they have been allocated more hours and this will be verified by the staffing team.

### End of contract

A PGTA will remain on our records at the end of their working period on 0%FTE, unless a resignation form is submitted.

### CS HR Sharepoint

This information will be reiterated in the recruitment email that will go out to all PHD students and is available on
the [CS HR SharePoint](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/ComputerScienceIntranet/SitePages/HR-and-Staffing.aspx).
(TR: It is not the purpose of this web page to say which emails mightbe send by whom. Is thsi really meant to be here?)
