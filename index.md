### Contacts

| Contact      | Email | Queries relating to...     |
| :---        |    :----:   | :--- |
| Tobias Ritschel | <t.ritschel@ucl.ac.uk> | Module leader requests. Budget. ML and PGTA application forms.  |
| UCL CS HR | <computerscience.hr@ucl.ac.uk> | Contracts. Payroll. Right to work check. |
| Sarah Sanders | <sarah.sanders@ucl.ac.uk> | Guidance and support to PGTAs for queries that fall outside of the above. |

TODO: One of the suggestions was providing a person as point of help for PGTAs, not sure if this is useful to provide or
not. I wouldn't want to become a gateway for all PGTA email queries however I'd be happy to provide guidance or support
if they aren't able to get this from their module lead.
