## How to calculate PGTA hours for a module

The following provides some typical examples as guidance. Your module may differ from the examples.

There is no change to previous years' guidance. This is aimed at staff new to requesting TA hours.

You only enter the total hours and number of roles on the PGTA request form. However, for the purposes of this guidance
the tasks have been split into:

- **Teaching**: labs, practicals
    - Calculate the total hours for a module. This may be over more than one term.
    - Add 50% to the total hours for preparation.
- **Support**: Moodle support, mandatory passive lecture/lab attendance, creating/modifying teaching materials
    - This may be regular e.g. 2 hours a week for 10 weeks = 20 hours; or a total sum e.g. port the coursework from
      Matlab to Python = 50 hours
- **Marking**: marking, second marking, and marking preparation for coursework and exams
    - Add hours based on the number of students. 20 mins per student per coursework is typical. Exam marking may take slightly longer. So if 50 students
      with 2 coursework and 1 exam then total = 50 hours.
    - The hours should include marking preparation, marking and any moderation.

### Example 1: Undergraduate Y3 module with 100 students, labs, coursework and exam

| Task      | Total hours | Calculated as...                                                     |
|:----------|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teaching  |     30      | 10 weeks, 1 x 2 hour lab per week = 20. Preparation = 50% x 20 = 10. |
| Support   |      0      | Not required.                                                        |
| Marking   |     50      | Each TA marks 1 coursework plus exam for 50 students so 50 * 1 hour. |
| **Total** |   **80**    | |

Number of TAs: 2

**Total requested:  2 x 80 = 160 hours**

### Example 2: Postgraduate module with 30 students, tutorial, coursework and exam marking

| Task      | Total hours | Calculated as...                                                         |
|:----------|:-----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teaching  |     15      | 10 weeks, 1 x 1 hour tutorial per week = 10. Preparation = 50% x 10 = 5. |
| Support   |      0      | Not required.                                                            |
| Marking   |     30      | TA marks 1 coursework plus exam for 30 students so 30 * 1 hour.          |
| **Total** |   **45**    |                                                                          |

Number of TAs: 1

**Total requested:  1 x 45 = 45 hours**

### Example 3: Undergraduate Y1 module with 200 students, 2 labs, 2 courseworks, and support

| Task      | Total hours | Calculated as...                                                                                         |
|:----------|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teaching  |     27      | 9 weeks only (no tutorial in final week), 1 x 2 hour tutorial per week = 18. Preparation = 50% x 18 = 9. |
| Support   |     10      | 1 hour per week on average over 10 weeks, Moodle queries.                                                |
| Marking   |     50      | TA marks 1 coursework plus exam for 50 students so 50 * 1 hour.                                          |
| **Total** |   **87**    |                                                                                                          |

Number of TAs: 4

**Total requested:  4 x 87 = 348 hours**

### Example 4: Undergraduate Y2 elective module with 100 students, 1 lab and system support

| Task      | Total hours | Calculated as...                                                     |
|:----------|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teaching  |     30      | 10 weeks, 1 x 2 hour lab per week = 20. Preparation = 50% x 20 = 10. |
| Support   |     20      | 2 hours per student drop in support sessions                         |
| Marking   |      0      | All marking done by Module Leader.                                   |
| **Total** |   **50**    |           

Total number of TAs to support labs: 2

1 x TA required to maintain the bespoke auto-grading system = 20 hours. 

**Total requested:**
  - 1 x 20 = 20 hours
  - 2 x 50 = 100 hours
  - **= 220 hours**
