## How to calculate PGTA hours for a module

The following provides some typical examples as guidance. Your module may differ from the examples given.

This is aimed at staff new to requesting TA hours.

### Teaching delivery

This refers to the work required during the term (or period) the module is taught.

Consider scheduled sessions (e.g. labs, practicals, tutorials, student project team meetings) as well as support work (
Moodle support, office hours, modifying materials).

For scheduled session, include the time for attending the relevant classes as well as preparation time.

Calculated typically as: `hours per TA x number of TAs`

### Marking (excluding end of year exam)

Module leaders would be expected to do marking. Where this is not possible due to the class sizes then PGTAs can assist.

Add hours based on the number of students. 20 mins per student per coursework is typical. The hours should include
marking preparation, marking and any moderation.

A typical calculation might be: `20 min x number of students x number of assessments`

Total marking (_including_ year-end exam) should not exceed 1 hour per student.

### Marking (end of year exam)

Module leaders would be expected to do marking. Where the number of student makes this impractical then PGTAs can assist.

Exam marking may take slightly longer than for other assessments. The hours should include marking preparation, marking
and any moderation.

A typical calculation might be: `30 min x number of students`

### Number of TAs

The number of TAs needed will depend on a number of factors. The following examples assume a ratio of 1 PGTA to 50
students.

### Example 1: Undergraduate Y3 module with 100 students, labs, coursework only

Number of TAs: 2
