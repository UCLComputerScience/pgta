## Information for PGTAs (RA)

### TL;DR:

All RAs are asked to contribute 40 hours of teaching to the [TA jobs listed here](https://tinyurl.com/dk4dzfmx0
by [filling the form here](https://forms.gle/6Jnsu8v9Z3jc7ohWA].

### Process steps

Contribution to teaching (TAing) is considered an integral part of your work at UCL, as covered by your work contract.
You are expected to get involved and make things better for our younger Computer Scientists!

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

#### 1) APPLY

Check the [announced vacancies](https://tinyurl.com/dk4dzfmx). Vacancies will remain open for at least 15 days.

To apply, [please fill the form](https://forms.gle/6Jnsu8v9Z3jc7ohWA).

More info about each module see the [module catalgue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

Each RA is being asked to contribute 40 TA hours total per academic year.
Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need your help the most.

#### 2) GET AN OFFER

We (not the Module Lead) will inform you if your application was considered within no more than 20 work days after the vacancy was published.

#### 3) QUALIFY

You are required to attend (attendance recorded!)

i) a three-hour Arena One Introductory Gateway Workshop ([schedule and registration](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/arena/one)).
- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate.
- You can TA before attending the Arena One Workshop, just attend it at the earliest available date this year.
- You only need to do this once ever.

ii) the Intro to CS TA'ing session that will take place virtually at a date TBA.

### PROCESS CHANGES

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants or vice versa directly to appoint them to modules, without
following the steps above.

It might be surprising to RA that they have to apply, while at the same time they are contractually required to do that.
Please consider how this matters for fairness if, e.g. one RA and one PhD student were to compete over a single position both must put in an application which both must be compared according to UCLs hiring standards.
RA need to do it so they can be compared to non-RA.
