## PGTA process for Research Fellows (RF) or Research Associates (RA)

### Summary
**All RF/RAs are asked to contribute 40 hours of teaching to the [2023-24 PGTA vacancies](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzz2en51FJDuL9udZgfhFb2NvQ4PmDpp4pU4Hn-b757eukx4Jqjhib_8PCaG49rBQBQFg/exec) by filling the [form](https://forms.gle/iuLJndrJVjdbUF5Q7).**

### Process steps

Contribution to teaching (TAing) is considered an integral part of your work at UCL. You are expected to get involved
and make things better for our student Computer Scientists!

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

------

#### 1) Apply

Check the [announced vacancies](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzz2en51FJDuL9udZgfhFb2NvQ4PmDpp4pU4Hn-b757eukx4Jqjhib_8PCaG49rBQBQFg/exec).

To apply, please fill the [form](https://forms.gle/iuLJndrJVjdbUF5Q7).

More info about each module see the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

To check the scheduled classes see the [UCL timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/tt/homePage.do). Use the Custom
Timetable option and change the year to the next academic year (see top right of the screen).

Each RF is being asked to contribute 40 TA hours total per academic year. Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need
your help the most.

#### 2) Get an offer

[Departmental lead for PGTAs](mailto:csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk) will inform you if your application was considered.

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants or vice versa directly to appoint them to modules, without
following the steps above.

#### 3) Qualify

You are required to attend (attendance recorded!) a three-hour Arena One Introductory Gateway
Workshop ([schedule and registration](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/arena/one)).

- You only need to do this once ever.
- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate.
- You can TA before attending the Arena One Workshop, just attend it at the earliest available date.
- Email proof of completion to the [Departmental lead for PGTAs](mailto:csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk)

### Why?

It might be surprising to an RF that they have to apply for PGTA work as this is an expected part of their duties. We
need to consider a fair recruitment practice for all. If, for example, there is more than one applicant for a single
position they must be considered in accordance with UCLâ€™s fair recruitment policy.
