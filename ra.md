## PGTA process for Research Fellows (RF)

**TL;DR: All RFs are asked to contribute 40 hours of teaching to the modules listed [here](https://tinyurl.com/mm69m93w)
by filling the [form](https://forms.gle/DAMEZXiiwoX3nsJn9).**

### Process steps

Contribution to teaching (TAing) is considered an integral part of your work at UCL, as covered by your work contract.
You are expected to get involved and make things better for our younger Computer Scientists!

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

------

#### 1) Apply

Check the [announced vacancies](https://tinyurl.com/mm69m93w).
Vacancies will remain open for at least 15 days.

To apply, please fill the [form](https://forms.gle/DAMEZXiiwoX3nsJn9).

More info about each module see the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

Each RF is being asked to contribute 40 TA hours total per academic year.
Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need your help the most.

#### 2) Get an offer

Tobias (not the Module Lead) will inform you if your application was considered within no more than 20 work days after the vacancy was published.

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants or vice versa directly to appoint them to modules, without following the steps above.

#### 3) Qualify

You are required to attend (attendance recorded!)

i) a three-hour Arena One Introductory Gateway Workshop ([schedule and registration](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/arena/one)).
- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate.
- You can TA before attending the Arena One Workshop, just attend it at the earliest available date this year.
- You only need to do this once ever.

ii) the Intro to CS TA'ing session that will take place virtually at a date TBA.

### Why?

It might be surprising to an RF that they have to apply for PGTA work as this is an expected part of their duties.
We need to consider a fair recruitment practice for all. if, e.g. there is more than one applicant for a single position they must be considered in accordance with UCLâ€™s fair recruitment policy.
