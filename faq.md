## FAQ

### How much PGTA time can a module leader request?

The department’s teaching depends on the support of excellent PGTAs, in particular for undergraduate courses. Please try
to economize on this short and valuable resource.
A guideline is found [here](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/pgta/blob/gh-pages/hours.html).

### How many hours should I work as PGTA?

As Research Associates (RA), you are *contractually required* to do contribute 40 hours.

All Research students (PhD and EngD) are *strongly encouraged* to TA as part of their duties.

### How many can a PGTA work?

PGTAs are employed as members of staff on short-term contracts.

They cannot work more than 180 hours/year or 6 hours/week as per the Postgraduate Teaching Assistant Code of Practice.

Their FTE will be determined by the total amount of hours worked, and will be calculated based upon the current term
dates, i.e. if someone is allocated 100 hours and the term is 10 weeks their FTE will be calculated over the 10 week
period, however the PGTA may be required to work some of those hours, outside of term time in preparation for the module
but their total work must not exceed their allocated hours. Any training, preparation and marking within the same term
must be factored into the total hours allocation for the module.

PGTAs who work across more than one term will have their FTE calculated separately for each term.

### How can I make a change to PGTA hours after they have been allocated?

Changing PGTA hours once they have been allocated is to be avoided. If the budget is to be changed, the Module Lead (not
the PGTA) has to inform Tobias first. Adjustments will be made if deemed necessary. Changes to FTE/contracts will be
made twice a term only, typically just after reading week and at the end of term.

### Is there two kind of RAs?
yes, there is Research Associates and (more rare) Research Assistants.
The latter typically are also Research Students, and they should follow the guidelines stated for these.

### How is excellent TA'ing recognised?

The department will recognise excellent TA’ing by a *Teaching Assistant Award*, to be presented at the departmental
summer party. A committee (HoD, Dept. Tutor and Graduate Tutor) will select three winners (awarded £250, each). To
identify candidates, but also to understand what needs improvement, we will monitor i) the quality of a TAs work, as
assessed both by module leads and by students in post-module surveys; ii) the quantity of teaching a TA performs; and
iii) a TAs coverage of undergrad modules.

TODO: PGTA's working on IEP modules, including IEP minors, may also be nominated for the IEP TA awards.

### What training is available for TA's?

All PGTAs must complete UCL's Arena for PGTAs (previously called Arena One). TAs indicate on their application
form if this has been completed or not. If not then Arena training hours will be added to a TA's contract and they will
be expected to enrol and complete the training.

Optionally a TA may wish to apply for recognition of their TA skills by applying for
a [Higher Education Authority (HEA) Associate Fellowhip](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/professional-development/ucl-arena/arena-fellowship)
award.

For module specific activities such as marking, supporting tutorials etc, please seek guidance from the module lead.
