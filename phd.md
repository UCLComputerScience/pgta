## Information for PGTAs (PhD candidates)

### TL;DR:

All CS Research Students asked to contribute 40 hours to the [listed TA jobs](https://tinyurl.com/dk4dzfmx)
by [filling the form](https://forms.gle/6Jnsu8v9Z3jc7ohWA).

### Steps

Teaching is an integral part of your training at UCL, as explained in your offer letter.
You are expected to get involved and make things better for our younger Computer Scientists!

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

#### 1) APPLY

Check the [announced vacancies](https://tinyurl.com/dk4dzfmx).
Vacancies will remain open for at least 15 days.

To apply, please [complete the form](https://forms.gle/6Jnsu8v9Z3jc7ohWA).

More info about each module is available in the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

Each CS Research Student is being asked to contribute 40 hours total in each academic year to a COMP or IEP module.
Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need your help the most, which is recognised by our *Teaching Assistant Award* (see below).

More than 40 hrs is great, but check with your PhD advisor.
You cannot work more than 180 hours/year or 6 hours/week.
For those on a Tier-4 visa, where it is an additional 20 hours/week limit.

#### 2) GET AN OFFER

We (not the Module Lead) will inform you if your application was considered within no more than 20 work days after the vacancy was published.

#### 3) CONTRACT

You will need to provide the Staffings Team with the required documents, including the Right-to-work (RTW) information.

To start, please [fill the form](https://tinyurl.com/2twjreav).

You must in no circumstances work before the contract is completed and the Staffing Teams tells you to do so.

#### 4) QUALIFY

You are required to attend (attendance recorded!)

i) a three-hour Arena One Introductory Gateway Workshop [schedule and registration](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/arena/one).
- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate. 
- You can TA before attending the Arena One Workshop.
Simply just attend that at the earliest available date this year.
- You only need to do this once ever.

ii) the Intro to CS TA'ing session that will take place virtually at a date TBA.

### PROCESS CHANGES

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants or vice versa directly to appoint them to modules, without
following the steps above.

All employees, including PGTAs, must present their Right To Work (RTW) before the start of their contract and cannot commence work until the original has been verified.
PGTAs will not be paid if they attempt to work before they have submitted their RTW.

There is no timesheet system like Dovico anymore.

### PAY AND CONTRACT

The compensation is £18.4/h and £22.84/h for lead positions on Y1/Y2 modules.
The contract will run across the entire academic year, with pro-rata monthly payments.
You also benefit from annual leave paid as a lump sum at the end of your studies.
For more information on the conditions, [see here](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/docs/post_grad_ta_scheme.php).

We award three prizes of £250 each to our best TAs, and a further four prizes of £50 each for honorable mentions.
These prizes aim to recognise those who have made an exceptional contribution to our teaching provision - by contributing a significant number of hours, mostly in support of our UG modules where need is higher, and receiving praises for their engagement and teaching quality by Module Leads.
To identify candidates, but also to understand what needs improvement, we will monitor

- i) the quality of a TAs work, as assessed both by module leads and by students in post-module surveys;
- ii) the quantity of teaching a TA performs; and
- iii) a TAs coverage of undergrad modules.
