## PGTA Process for Research Students

**TL;DR: All CS Research Students are asked to contribute 40 hours to
the [advertised](https://forms.gle/RZSDJfEy5A9AnPyn7) by applying using [this](https://forms.gle/DAMEZXiiwoX3nsJn9) form
and, once accepted, this [form](https://forms.gle/mi45XNWa8SHKc24B9)**.

### Steps

Teaching is an integral part of your training at UCL, as explained in your offer letter. You are expected to get
involved and make things better for our younger Computer Scientists!

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

-----------

#### 1) Apply

Check the [announced vacancies](https://tinyurl.com/dk4dzfmx). Vacancies will remain open for at least 15 days. More
info about each module is available at the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

To apply, please complete theis [form](https://forms.gle/DAMEZXiiwoX3nsJn9).

Each CS Research Student is being asked to contribute 40 hours total in each academic year to a COMP or IEP module.
Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need your help the most, which is recognised by our *Teaching Assistant
Award* (see below).

More than 40 hrs is great, but check with your PhD advisor. PGTA cannot work more than 180 hours/year or 6 hours/week.
For those on a Tier-4 visa, where it is an additional 20 hours/week limit.

#### 2) Get an offer

The Department (not the Module Lead) will inform applicants if they were considered within no more than 20 work days
after the vacancy was published.

#### 3) Get a contract

PGTAs are employed as members of staff on short-term contracts.

Accepted applicants will need to provide CSHR with the required documents, including the Right-to-work (
RTW) information.

To start, applicants will need to fill a separate second [form](https://forms.gle/mi45XNWa8SHKc24B9) with further
details. This needs only to be done once by every individual applicant per year.

PGTA Applicants must present their Right To Work (RTW) before the start of their contract and cannot commence work until
the original has been verified.

#### 4) Qualify

PGTA are required to attend (attendance recorded!)

i) a three-hour Arena One Introductory Gateway Workshop [schedule and registration](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/arena/one).

- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate.
- You can TA before attending the Arena One Workshop. Simply just attend that at the earliest available date this year.
- This only needs to be done once, ever.

ii) the Intro to CS TA'ing session that will take place virtually at a date TBA.

-----------

### What is not permissible

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants or vice versa directly to appoint them to modules, without
following the steps above.

PGTA applicants will not be paid if they attempt to work before they have submitted their RTW.

Also, a PGTA must in no circumstances work before the contract is requested and the CSHR team tells you to do so.

### Contract changes

Changing PGTA hours once they have been allocated is to be avoided. PGTA cannot change their hours. If a PGTA thinks
they have worked more or less hours than agreed, they should talk to their ML.

### Payment

UCL PGTAs are recruited at Grade 6, spine point 21, £15.66/hr however PGTAs teaching on a Computer Science module
attract a market supplement of spine point 28 £18.81/hr for first time PGTAs and spine point 36, £23.32 for returning
PGTAs, the following year. Hourly rates are listed at the current 2021-2022 UCL rates and may be subject to change -
UCL Salary Scales. You also benefit from annual leave paid as a lump sum at the end of your
studies. For more information on the conditions, see [here](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hr/docs/post_grad_ta_scheme.php).

The TA FTE will be determined by the total amount of hours worked, and will be calculated based upon the current term
dates. I.e., if someone is allocated 100 hours and the term is 10 weeks their FTE will be calculated over the 10 week
period, however the PGTA may be required to work some of those hours, outside of term time in preparation for the module
but their total work must not exceed their allocated hours.

PGTAs who work across more than one term will have their FTE calculated from separately for each term.

A PGTA will remain on our records at the end of their working period on 0%FTE, unless a resignation form is submitted.

There is no timesheet system like Dovico anymore.
