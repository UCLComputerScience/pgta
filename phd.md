## PGTA Process for UCL Research Students, UCL Research Assistants and External applicants

### Summary

1. Check
   the [advertised vacancies](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzz2en51FJDuL9udZgfhFb2NvQ4PmDpp4pU4Hn-b757eukx4Jqjhib_8PCaG49rBQBQFg/exec) (
   warning: not supported on Safari)
2. Apply using [this form](https://forms.gle/iuLJndrJVjdbUF5Q7)
3. Attend
   an [Introductory Gateway Workshop](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/professional-development/arena-one/gateway-workshops)
   . If you have attended in a previous year then you do not need to attend again.

**You cannot work until your RTW evidence has been verified by a member of UCL staff, and we cannot verify RTW
retrospectively, by law.** Failure to present your RTW, or to apply through the proper channels will result in you not
being paid.

**All UCL CS Research Students are asked to contribute a minimum of 40 hours**. Teaching is an integral part of your training at UCL, as explained in your offer letter. You are expected to get
involved and make things better for our Computer Scientists!

### Steps

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

-----------

#### 1) Apply

Each CS Research Student is asked to contribute a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 180 hours (average 6 hours per
week) in each academic year to a COMP or IEP module. Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need your help the most.
Note that:

- Please check with your PhD advisor if you would like to work more than 40 hours.
- A PGTA cannot work more than 180 hours/year or 6 hours/week.
- For those on a Tier-4 visa, there is an additional 20 hours/week limit.

Check
the [announced vacancies](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzz2en51FJDuL9udZgfhFb2NvQ4PmDpp4pU4Hn-b757eukx4Jqjhib_8PCaG49rBQBQFg/exec) (
Safari not supported).

More info about each module is available at the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

You are advised to check the module timetable to see when classes are scheduled using
the [UCL timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/tt/homePage.do). Use the Custom Timetable option and change the year to
the next academic year (see top right of the screen).

To apply, please complete this [form](https://forms.gle/iuLJndrJVjdbUF5Q7).

All vacancies will be released on the same day. After 10 working days all applications will be sent to the module
leaders to review. Any applications received after the initial deadline may still be considered but priority will be
given to those submitted before the deadline.

#### 2) Get an offer

The [Departmental lead for PGTAs](mailto:csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk) will inform applicants if they were successful within no more than 20 working days after
the vacancy was published.

#### 3) Get a contract

PGTAs are employed as members of staff on short-term contracts.

Accepted applicants will need to provide [CSHR](mailto:computerscience.hr@ucl.ac.uk) with the required documents, including the Right-To-Work (RTW)
information.

[CSHR](mailto:computerscience.hr@ucl.ac.uk) will be in touch once your position is confirmed to onboard you.

You cannot work until your RTW evidence has been verified by a member of UCL staff, and we cannot verify RTW
retrospectively, by law. Failure to present your RTW, or to apply through the proper channels will result in you not
being paid.

#### 4) Qualify

PGTA are required to attend a three-hour Introductory Gateway
Workshop ([schedule and registration here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/professional-development/arena-one/gateway-workshops)
).

- This only needs to be done once, ever.
- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate.
- You can TA before attending the Gateway Workshop. Attend a session at the earliest available date this year.

To receive payment for the workshop, please email evidence of completion (e.g. screenshot of the training record showing
completion/attendance) to <csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk>.

### What is not permissible

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants, or vice versa, directly to appoint them to modules,
without following the steps above.

A PGTA must in no circumstances work before their RTW has been agreed; a contract is requested and the [CSHR](mailto:computerscience.hr@ucl.ac.uk) team tells
you to do so. You cannot be paid if you attempt to do so.

### Contract changes

Changing PGTA hours once they have been allocated is to be avoided and PGTAs should not change their hours. If you think
you will work more or fewer hours than agreed, you should talk to your ML in the first instance before changing hours.
The ML will need to gain budget approval from [Sarah Sanders](mailto:csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk) before any increases can be authorised. Any reduction in
hours, could result in overpayment, which will be recalled by UCL.

### Payment

The PGTA starting salary is paid at Grade 6, spine point 21 pro rata. You will increment a spine point each year of
service as a PGTA.

You will also receive a market supplement of £6,200 pro rata for first your first year of teaching in the department of
Computer Science rising to £13,800 pro rata thereafter.

The [2023-24 salary scale is here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/sites/human_resources/files/23_24ucl_non-clinical_grade_structure_with_spinal_points_feb-23_v2.pdf)
.

Please check your spine point and market supplement and notify [CSHR](mailto:computerscience.hr@ucl.ac.uk) if you believe it to be incorrect.

You also benefit from annual leave paid as lump sum at the end of your studies. For more information on the conditions,
see [HR and finance advice for PGTAs here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pg-teaching-opportunities-hub/home/getting-started-pgta-ucl)
.

The PGTA FTE will be determined by the total amount of hours worked, and will be calculated based upon the current term
dates. i.e. if someone is allocated 100 hours and the term is 10 weeks their FTE will be calculated over the 10 week
period, however the PGTA may be required to work some of those hours, outside of term time in preparation for the module
but their total work must not exceed their allocated hours.

PGTAs who work across more than one term will have their FTE calculated across both terms.

A PGTA will remain on our records at the end of their working period on 0%FTE, unless a resignation form is submitted.

There is no timesheet system like Dovico anymore.
