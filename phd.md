### Steps

Teaching is an integral part of your training at UCL, as explained in your offer letter. You are expected to get
involved and make things better for our younger Computer Scientists!

Matching TAs and modules proceeds as follows:

-----------

#### 1) Apply

Each CS Research Student is being asked to contribute 40 hours total in each academic year to a COMP or IEP module.
Undergraduate modules are a priority, and need your help the most.

More than 40 hrs is great, but check with your PhD advisor. A PGTA cannot work more than 180 hours/year or 6 hours/week.
For those on a Tier-4 visa, there is an additional 20 hours/week limit.

Check the [announced vacancies]() (TBC for 23/24).

More info about each module is available at the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/).

You are advised to check the module timetable to see when classes are scheduled using
the [UCL timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/tt/homePage.do). Use the Custom Timetable option and change the year to
the next academic year (see top right of the screen).

To apply, please complete this [form]() (TBC for 23/24).

All vacancies will be released on the same day. After 15 days all applications will be sent to the module leaders to
review. Any applications received after the 15 days will be considered as soon as they are submitted.

#### 2) Get an offer

The Department (not the Module Lead) will inform applicants if they were considered within no more than 20 work days
after the vacancy was published.

#### 3) Get a contract

PGTAs are employed as members of staff on short-term contracts.

Accepted applicants will need to provide CSHR with the required documents, including the Right-to-work (
RTW) information.

To start, applicants will need to fill a separate second [form]() (TBC for 23/24) with further
details. This needs only to be done once by every individual applicant per year.

PGTA Applicants must present their Right To Work (RTW) before the start of their contract and cannot commence work until
the original has been verified.

#### 4) Qualify

PGTA are required to attend a three-hour Introductory Gateway
Workshop [schedule and registration](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/professional-development/arena-one/gateway-workshops)
.

- This only needs to be done once, ever.
- Attendees will be paid at the standard hourly rate.
- You can TA before attending the Gateway Workshop. Simply just attend that at the earliest available date this year.

To receive payment for the workshop, please email evidence of completion (e.g. screenshot of the training record showing
completion/attendance) to <csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk>.

### What is not permissible

Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants, or vice versa, directly to appoint them to modules,
without following the steps above.

A PGTA must in no circumstances work before their RTW has been agreed; a contract is requested and the CSHR team tells
you to do so. You cannot be paid if you attempt to do so.

### Contract changes

Changing PGTA hours once they have been allocated is to be avoided. PGTA cannot change their hours. If a PGTA thinks
they have worked more or fewer hours than agreed, they should talk to their ML in the first instance. The ML will need to
gain budget approval from Sarah Sanders before any increases can be authorised.

### Payment

The PGTA starting salary is paid at Grade 6, spine point 21, salary £30,696 (23/24 rate TBC) pro rata with a market
supplement of £6,200 (23/24 rate TBC)
pro rata for first your first year of teaching rising to £13,800 (23/24 rate TBC) pro rata thereafter.
The [2022-23 salary scale](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/sites/human_resources/files/22_23ucl_non-clinical_grade_structure_with_spinal_points.pdf)
is here. You will also increment a spine point each year of service as a PGTA.

You also benefit from annual leave paid as lump sum at the end of your studies. For more information on the conditions,
see [HR and finance advice for PGTAs here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pg-teaching-opportunities-hub/home/getting-started-pgta-ucl)
.

The TA FTE will be determined by the total amount of hours worked, and will be calculated based upon the current term
dates. i.e. if someone is allocated 100 hours and the term is 10 weeks their FTE will be calculated over the 10 week
period, however the PGTA may be required to work some of those hours, outside of term time in preparation for the module
but their total work must not exceed their allocated hours.

PGTAs who work across more than one term will have their FTE calculated across both terms.

A PGTA will remain on our records at the end of their working period on 0%FTE, unless a resignation form is submitted.

There is no timesheet system like Dovico anymore.

apply for
a [Higher Education Authority (HEA) Associate Fellowhip](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/professional-development/ucl-arena/arena-fellowship)
award.
