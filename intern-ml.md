## Intern process for module leaders

Some teaching support roles may be suitable for undergraduate internships.

Please note:

- Interns cannot be asked to carry out any assessment related tasks
- Interns are not PGTAs and will not have completed PGTA training. Please make sure you provide them with any training
  and guidance needed to perform the role.

All UCL internships must comply
with [UCL policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/internships-work-experience-and-volunteering-policy#definitions)
.

## Process for 2022-23

1. Please email X with **all** the following details to get the intern ad listed:
  - Module code
  - How many of your current approved hours that have not been filled by PGTAs that you wish to use for interns
  - Description of the role (make sure there are no assessment related activities!)
  - Description of the skills/experience needed by the candidates
  - Expected time commitment eg 2 hours per week, 10 weeks of term 1, total 20 hours
  - Start and end date (particularly if these differ to the term start/end dates)

    If you already have one or more candidates that you have agreed to offer the internship to, please provide their names,
    email addresses, and the total hours (per candidate).

3. New applications will be emailed to you, usually the day they are received. Please contact the applicant(s). If you
   decline their application, please tell them and give them a brief reason why not. If you wish to hire them let them
   know and tell them that **they** must create an account at [www.unitemps.com](www.unitemps.com) and conduct a right

   completing a RTW check.
