## Intern process for module leaders

Some teaching support roles may be suitable for undergraduate internships. Please note:

- Interns cannot be asked to carry out any assessment related tasks.
- Interns are not PGTAs and will not have completed PGTA training. You will need to provide them with any training
  and guidance needed to perform the role. 
- All UCL internships must comply
with [UCL policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/internships-work-experience-and-volunteering-policy#definitions)
.

Information for undergraduate students is [listed separately here](https://uclcomputerscience.github.io/intern/).

### Process for 2022-23

1. To advertise a role complete
   the [form here](https://forms.gle/GHNz3vYx1y2zVY7y5).
2. To employ interns without advertising, i.e. if you already have Y2+ undergraduate students you have
   agreed the role with, **go to step 4**.
3. Internship ads
   are [advertised here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i-dtPKUHxlW93iTH4jn-ZN5wU8cUdoKnFMJ-PunvSy8).
4. New applications will be emailed to you, usually the day they are received. Please contact the applicant(s).
    - If you decline their application, please tell them and give them a brief reason why not.
    - If you wish to hire them please email [Sarah Sanders](mailto:sarah.sanders@ucl.ac.uk?subject=Intern%20request)
      with:
        - name(s)
        - email address(es)
        - total hours (for each candidate)
        - term (or start/end date if not term dates)
        - name and email of the module leader who will act as their manager (unless it is you)
    - **NB**: they can't start work until they are registered with Unitemps and their right to work has been verified.
5. The module leader who is managing the intern will need to electronically sign their timesheets. Unitemps will send
   notifications when this is required.
