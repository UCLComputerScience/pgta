## Information for Module Leaders

TL;DR: Module leads have to [request](https://forms.gle/X311EkXpwZkkgWwX7) PGTAs for 2022/23.

### Steps

#### 1. REQUESTING

Module leads (ML) make requests for PGTA positions [here](https://forms.gle/X311EkXpwZkkgWwX7) by 1/7/2022, CoB for each of their module(s), even Term 2 and 3.

New module leads may wish to read the [guidance for calculating total PGTA hours](hours.html).

#### 2. BUDGETING

MLs will hear back from Tobias directly if the request is approved or if adjustments are advised.

#### 3. ADVERTISING

Positions will directly be advertised online [here](https://tinyurl.com/mm69m93w) for a period of no less than 15 work days.
This URL will be circulated to all PhD students and RA and is publicly visible.
MLs may share with those eligible, also outside UCL.
Candidates can express their interest by filling a [form](https://forms.gle/vqfNfGuxjxzaK9no6), stating which module they want to cover, for how many hours and optionally why.

It is no longer possible for MLs to nominate somebody for a position in this online form or in any other way.
UCL recruitment rules require all posts to be advertised.

#### 4. SELECTION

After 15 work days have passed, the ML is emailed the list of applicants.

We have three cases: 

if the number of hours the candidates have offered...

- ...matches the budget, the ML just confirms and applicants will be made an offer.
- ...is less than the budget, the ML confirms, applicants will be made an offer, and the remaining hours
  will be re-advertised.
- ...is more than the budget, the ML has to make a choice and give a justification, following fairness
  rules of UCL hiring before we will make an offer.

#### 5. CONTRACTING

Staffings will follow up with those applicants who were made an offer.

It is the Mls responsibility to ensure that all PGTA working with them have been properly recruited, compliant with UK Government legislation, before they are assigned any duty.
TA must present their Right To Work (RTW) before the start of their contract and cannot commence work until the original has been verified by the Staffings team.
PGTAs will not be paid if they attempt to work before they have submitted their RTW.

Contracts will only be started or amended after the following dates, changes requested between these dates will be held to the next date:

TODO: Check the actual dates 
- For contracts starting in term 1: end August, end of reading week, end of January 
- For contracts starting in term 2: end November, end of reading week, week 1 of term 3 (i.e. after Easter)

#### 6. MENTORING
ML are in charge of TAs and will need to mentor them as issues come up.
