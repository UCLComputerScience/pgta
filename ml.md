### Steps

Please follow the steps below to benefit from teaching assistants for your module:

-------

#### 1. Requesting

Module leads (ML) make requests for PGTA positions [here](https://forms.gle/2X7t65QdJykbVgzP8) by 20/05/2023, CoB for
each of their module(s), even Term 2 and 3.

New module leads should read the [guidance for calculating total PGTA hours](hours.html).

If multiple people co-teach a module it is assumed that a single consolidated request is submitted. If multiple requests
are made, only the last one is considered.

#### 2. Budgeting

MLs will hear back from Sarah Sanders if the request is approved or if adjustments are advised.

#### 3. Advertising

Positions will be advertised online [here](https://tinyurl.com/mm69m93w) for a period of no less than 15 work days.

This link will be circulated to all PhD students and RA and is publicly visible. MLs may share with those eligible, also
outside UCL.

It is no longer possible for MLs to nominate somebody for a position in this online form or in any other way. UCL
requires all posts to be advertised to ensure fair and transparent recruitment practice has taken place.

#### 4. Selection

After 15 work days have passed, the ML is emailed the list of applicants.

We have three cases: if the number of hours the candidates have offered...

1. ... matches the budget, the ML just confirms and applicants will be made an offer.
2. ... is less than the budget, the ML confirms, applicants will be made an offer, and the remaining hours will be
   re-advertised.
3. ... is more than the budget, the ML has to make a choice and give a justification, following fairness rules of UCL
   hiring before we will make an offer.

#### 5. Contracting

CSHR will follow up with those applicants who were made an offer.

It is the ML's responsibility to ensure that all PGTA working with them have been properly recruited, compliant with UK
Government legislation, before they are assigned any duty. TA must present their Right To Work (RTW) before the start of
their contract and cannot commence work until the original has been verified by a member of UCL staff. PGTAs will not be
paid if they attempt to work before they have submitted their RTW.

Contracts will only be started or amended after the following dates, changes requested between these dates will be held
to the next date:

- For contracts starting in term 1:
    - end August,
    - end of Reading Week,
    - end of January
- For contracts starting in term 2:
    - end November,
    - end of Reading week,
    - week 1 of term 3 (i.e. after Easter)

##### Contract changes

Contract changes are to be avoided.

If a ML would like to change the hours for a PGTA, they have to contact [Sarah Sanders](mailto:csc.postgradta@ucl.ac.uk)
.

A PGTA should not request to change their hours, neither with Sarah nor with HR.

Any increases to PGTA FTE allocation will be made at set points in the academic year (see above
and [key dates](/index#key-dates)).

#### 6. Mentoring

ML are in charge of TAs and will need to mentor them as issues come up.
