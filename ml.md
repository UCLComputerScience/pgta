## Information for Module Leaders

### TL;DR
Module leads have to [request PGTAs for 2022/23](https://forms.gle/7hRqRzLpKm3XUZ966). **TODO: correct form link**

[Guidance for calculating total PGTA hours if you need it]("./hours.html).

### Steps

#### 1. REQUESTING

Module leads make requests for PGTA positions at [TBC]() by *DATE TBC* 2022, CoB for each of their module(s), even
Term 2 and 3.

It is no longer possible for Module Leads to nominate somebody for a position in this online form or in any other
way. UCL recruitment rules have changed and require all posts to be advertised, sorry.

#### 2. BUDGETING

Module leaders will hear back from Tobias directly if the request is approved or if adjustments are advised.

#### 3. ADVERTISING

Positions will directly be advertised online at [TBC]() for a period of no less than 15 work days. This URL will be
circulated to all PhD students and RA and is publicly visible. You may share with those eligible.

#### 4. EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

Candidates will express their interest by filling a form at [TBC]()saying which module they want to cover, for how
many hours and optionally why.

#### 5. SELECTION

After 15 work days have passed, the module leader is emailed the list of applicants.

We have three cases: 

if the number of hours the candidates have offered...

- ...matches the budget, the module leader just confirms and applicants will be made an offer.
- ...is less than the budget, the module leader confirms, applicants will be made an offer, and the remaining hours
  will be re-advertised.
- ...is more than the budget, the module leader has to make a choice and give a justification, following fairness
  rules of UCL hiring before we will make an offer.

#### 6. CONTRACTING

Staffings will follow up with those applicants who were made an offer.

No PGTA must work, ever, ever, ever, until the required documents have been provided to the Staffings Team, checked and approved.

Contracts will only be started or amended after the following dates, changes requested between these dates will be
   held to the next date:

TODO: Check the actual dates 
- For contracts starting in term 1: end August, end of reading week, end of January 
- For contracts starting in term 2: end November, end of reading week, week 1 of term 3 (i.e. after Easter)

#### 7. MENTORING

Module Leads are in charge of TAs and will need to mentor them as issues come up.

## Process changes from prior years

1. Under no circumstances should Module Leads contact applicants directly to appoint them to modules, without following
   the steps above.
2. All employees, including PGTAs, must present their Right To Work (RTW) before the start of their contract and cannot
   commence work until the original has been verified. PGTAs will not be paid if they attempt to work before they have
   submitted their RTW. It is the Module Leaders responsibility to ensure that their PGTA has been properly recruited
   and should ensure all PGTA's work with CS HR to complete all right-to-work checks
3. There is no timesheet system like Dovico anymore.
4. Contracts will only be created or modified at the dates listed in step 6.
